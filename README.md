# smi2021

The purpose of this repository is to merge and clean up several of the forks available.

## Minimal requirement

- Kernel version must be greater than or equal to 3.12

## Installing

### From you distro.

Ready distro:

- Arch Linux - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/somagic-easycap-smi2021-git/

> If you've packaged it for another distro, please send me the link and I'll add it.

### Manual build and installation

#### Get source

```
git clone git://github.com/Manouchehri/smi2021.git
cd smi2021/
```

#### Build

You can build that module one of the two options: as `internal` or as `external` (out-of-tree) module.
> if you have been collecting both ways - don't forget that in every way the final installation path of the module are different:
>
> **internal** = ``` /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/media/usb/smi2021/smi2021.ko ```
>
> **external** = ``` /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/smi2021.ko ```
>
> It might be possible - two different module will be in two different place at the same time - don't forget to delete the old module if you change the type of Assembly.

1. Build as **internal**:
  1.  Place folder `smi2021` from **Get source** step in you kernel source tree into folder `drivers/media/usb/`
  2.  In **menuconfig** (or other configuration utilits as xmenuconfig, etc...) Chose ```Device Drivers -> Multimedia support -> Media USB Adapters -> Somagic SMI2021 USB video/audio capture support``` as module or build-in
  3.  Build you kernel with modules and instal it. If you chose `Somagic SMI2021 USB video/audio capture support` as module - install modules too.
    
    > On build it as module - that module installs in ```/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/media/usb/smi2021/smi2021.ko```

2. Build as **external** (out-of-tree) module.
  1. You **MUST** verify all dependency:
    - `VIDEO_DEV && I2C && SND && USB`
    - `SND_PCM`
    - `VIDEO_SAA711X` = `Device Drivers -> Multimedia support -> Encoders, decoders, sensors and other helper chips -> Philips SAA7111/3/4/5 video decoders`
    - `VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC` = I simple chose in menuconfig: `Device Drivers -> Multimedia support -> Media USB Adapters -> USB Video Class` - it have needed dependency for `VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC`
    
    > Im most case, in blank `Encoders, decoders, sensors and other helper chips` and `Media USB Adapters` - when you not select `Cameras/video grabbers support`.
    > Also sufficient **UN**select `Autoselect ancillary drivers (tuners, sensors, i2c, frontends)` for view `Encoders, decoders, sensors and other helper chips` in list. 
  2. As is "https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt".
    
    > NOTE: "modules_prepare" will not build Module.symvers even if CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set; therefore, a full kernel build needs to be executed to make module versioning work.
  To build against the running kernel use: ```make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=$PWD```
  3. Build module with run `make` in source directory. You can use targets: `modules` as default `modules_install clean help` and `clean_all`. You can use env `CROSS_COMPILE, ARCH, KDIR` and `-j` too.
  4. Install builded module with `make modules_install`.
    
    > NOTE: It installs in ```/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/smi2021.ko```

#### Install firmware

After installing the module, you will have to copy `firmware/smi2021_3c.bin` (md5sum: `90f78491e831e8db44cfdd6204a2b602`) as `/usr/lib/firmware/smi2021_3c.bin`. If you Google the hash, you'll find guides that explain how to extract it.

#### Verify installation

- you can check, what `saa7115` module proper init you device (need once on first install, or new linux distrib, or with new smi2021 device(for proper check what they detected correct)). 
For that check, you need 
    - load saa7115 modules with debug: ```modprobe -r saa7115; modprobe saa7115 debug=1```
    - load smi2021 and check dmesg: must be string like: ```saa7115 8-004a: gm7113c found @ 0x94 (smi2021)```
